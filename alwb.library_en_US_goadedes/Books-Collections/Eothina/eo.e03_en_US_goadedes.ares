And He confirmed * by many signs the message."

eo.Doxasticon.text = "When Mary Magdalene brought the good news, that the Savior had risen from the dead, and that He had appeared to her, the disciples did not believe her. So they were upbraided for their hardness of heart. But once they were fully equipped with the signs and miracles, they were sent out to preach the gospel. Then You, O Lord, were taken up to Your Father, the Source of Light; and they went forth and preached everywhere, and the message was confirmed by the miracles. And now we, who through them have been enlightened, glorify Your resurrection from the dead, O benevolent Lord."
