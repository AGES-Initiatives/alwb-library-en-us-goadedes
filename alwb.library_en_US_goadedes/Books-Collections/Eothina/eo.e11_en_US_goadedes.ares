eo.Doxasticon.text = "After the resurrection, O Savior, You revealed yourself to Your disciples, and You gave Simon the pasturing of the sheep, in return for his love, asking him to take care to pastor them. That is why You said, \"If you love me, Peter, tend my lambs, tend my sheep.\" Then Peter displayed his affection for the other disciple and directly inquired about him. By their intercessions, O Christ, protect Your flock from savage wolves that would ravage it."
