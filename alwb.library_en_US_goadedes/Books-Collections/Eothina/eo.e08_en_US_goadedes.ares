But, as a weak woman, her thinking was still earthbound, and therefore she was prevented from laying hands on You, O Christ. Nevertheless, she was sent as a herald to Your disciples; and she told them the good news, and announced that You were ascending to Your Father. O Master, we pray that as with her You also make us worthy of Your appearance, O Lord."
