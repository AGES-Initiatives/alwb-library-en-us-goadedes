O benevolent Lord, let our prayer be set forth before You as incense, and accept it as a fragrant offering. Grant us a peaceful evening and night. Put on us the armor of light. Rescue us from night terrors and from anything lurking in darkness; and let our sleep, which You gave us for rest in our weakness, be free of any demonic fantasies. Please do this, O Master of all and Giver of good things, and we will remember Your name as we lie in bed at night; and, enlightened through meditation on Your commandments, we will wake up with joy in our souls and glorify Your goodness; and by virtue of Your compassion we will offer up prayers and supplications for our own misdeeds and those of all Your people. We pray You visit them with Your mercy, at the intercessions of the holy Theotokos."

The Deacon, fully vested (except for his cuffs) and head covered, bows to the Priest, exits the sanctuary through the north door, approaches the Beautiful Gate, nods towards the hierarchical Throne, and reverently bows; he takes the orarion in his right hand, faces the icon of the Lord on the icon screen, and intones the Great Litany, i.e. the Litany of Peace. The Choirs sing “Lord, have mercy” once after each petition, antiphonally. When there is no Deacon, the Priest says Litany of Peace, standing before the holy Table, head uncovered."
