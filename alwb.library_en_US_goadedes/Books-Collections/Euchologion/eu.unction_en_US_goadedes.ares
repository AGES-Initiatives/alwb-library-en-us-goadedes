euUNC.Key0301.text = "Unoriginate, eternal, most holy God, You sent Your only-begotten Son, who cured every disease and every sickness of our souls and bodies. We pray You send down Your Holy Spirit and sanctify this oil; and when Your servants are anointed with it, make it be for them complete release from their sins and inheritance of the kingdom of heaven."
euUNC.Key0302.text = "For You are great and marvelous God, who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You. You give release from sins through Your holy servant, Jesus Christ. You regenerated us from sin. You give sight to the blind and restore the broken down. You love the righteous and have mercy on sinners. You brought us out of darkness and the shadow of death, saying to those in bonds, \"Come out!\" and to those in darkness, \"Show yourselves!\" For the light of the knowledge of Your only-begotten Son has shined in our hearts; since, for our sake, He appeared on earth and dwelt among men; and to all who received Him, He gave the power to become Your children, O God. He granted us adoption through the bath of regeneration, and freed us from the devil's oppression. He was not pleased that we be cleansed by blood; but rather He granted us to be anointed with oil in the sign of His Cross, so that when He had purified us with water and sanctified us with the Holy Spirit, we might become the flock of Christ, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. O Lord and Master, bestow grace on this ministry of Yours, as You did with Moses Your servant and Samuel Your beloved, John Your chosen one and all those who in every generation have been pleasing to You. Likewise with this oil, allow us to be ministers of Your Son's new covenant, which You obtained with His precious blood; so that we may take off worldly passions and die to sin, and put on Christ Jesus, our Lord, and live in righteousness, through the holy Unction we are about to perform. O Lord, let this oil be oil of gladness, oil of sanctification, a royal garment, a strong breastplate averting every diabolical action, an inviolable seal, exceeding joy of heart, everlasting gladness; so that those who are anointed with this regenerative oil may be frightening to their foes, and may shine in the splendor of Your saints, without spot or wrinkle; that they may be admitted to Your eternal Jubilee, and may receive the prize of the heavenly call."

euUNC.Key0401.text = "Great and most high God, whom all creation worships, source of wisdom, truly unsearchable ocean of goodness and immense gulf of compassion; benevolent Lord, whose wonders are from the beginning, God whom no human can understand or comprehend: Consider us and hear us, Your unworthy servants. And as we, here, present this oil in Your great name, send down Your gift of healing and forgiveness of sins, and heal the people in the abundance of Your mercy. Yes indeed, O forgiving Lord, singularly merciful and benevolent, You relent from punishing our wicked deeds, for You know that the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth. You desire not the death of sinners, but rather that they should turn and live; and for sinners' salvation, You as God became human, being formed for the ones You had formed. It is You who said, \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.\" It is You who went after the sheep that was lost; You who searched carefully and found the lost coin. It is You who said, \"I will not cast out anyone who comes to me\"; and who did not abhor the harlot who washed Your precious feet with her tears. It is You who said, \"Whenever you fall, get up, and you will be saved.\" It is You who said that heaven rejoices whenever a sinner repents. Look at us now from Your holy height, O tender-loving Master, and overshadow us, sinful, unworthy servants of Yours, with the grace of the Holy Spirit. Dwell among Your servants who admit their transgressions and approach You with faith, and accept them; and graciously forgive and blot out any sin they committed in word, deed, or thought, and cleanse them. Be with them always and guard the rest of their lives, as they walk in the way of Your statutes; and may they never again be a laughingstock to the devil, so that Your all-holy name may be glorified in them."

We entreat You, our God, to bring Your mercy on this oil, and on those who are anointed with it in Your name, so that it may effect their healing of soul and body, the purging of every disease and infirmity and any infection of body and soul, and relief from all suffering. Yes indeed, Lord, please send Your medicinal power from heaven. Touch the body, lower the fever, ease the pain, and eliminate every hidden ailment. Be the Physician of these Your servants.

euUNC.Key0701.text = "Lord our God, You chasten and then again heal; You raise the poor man from the earth and lift up the poor from the dunghills. Father of orphans, haven of the storm-tossed, and physician of the sick, who easily takes our infirmities and bears our diseases; who cheerfully shows mercy, pardoning iniquities and passing over transgression; quick to help and slow to wrath. You breathed on Your disciples, and said to them, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven.\" You accept the repentance of sinners and have the authority to forgive people their many and grievous sins, and You provide healing to all kinds of people who are sick and chronically ill. Moreover, though I am a low, sinful, and unworthy servant of Yours, entangled in many sins and wallowing in carnal pleasures, yet I have been appointed by You to the loft holy orders of the priesthood, to enter the holy of holies behind the curtain, into which the holy angels long to look, and to hear the evangelic voice of the Lord God, and to see with their own eyes the outward appearance of the holy anaphora, and to experience the divine and sacred Liturgy. You have allowed me to perform Your heavenly sacraments, to offer You gifts and sacrifices for my own misdeeds and those committed in ignorance by the people, and to intercede on behalf of Your rational sheep, that You will blot out their transgressions, through Your abundant and ineffable benevolence. O King, supremely good, give ear to my prayer now, on this holy day, and always and everywhere, and heed the voice of my supplication. Cure these Your servants, who are sick in soul and body, and grant them forgiveness of sins, and pardon their voluntary and involuntary offenses. Heal their incurable wounds, every disease, and every infirmity. Grant them healing of soul and mind, O Lord, who touched Peter's mother-in-law, and the fever left her, and she rose and served You. O Master, grant to these Your servants healing and relief from any debilitating pain. Remember Your abundant compassion and Your mercy. Remember that the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; that no one on earth is without sin, for only You are without sin, You who came and saved the human race, and freed us from slavery to the enemy. For if You were to put Your servants on trial, none would be found to be pure and undefiled; but every mouth would be stopped, having nothing to say in defense, inasmuch as all our righteousness is like a filthy rag before You. Therefore, please do not remember the sins of our youth, O Lord."

euUNC.Key0800.title = "Prayer 6"
euUNC.Key0801.text = "We thank You, O Lord our God, good and benevolent, the physician of our souls and bodies, who easily bears our diseases, and by whose bruises we are all healed. You are the good shepherd, who came in search of the sheep that went astray. You give comfort to the fainthearted, and life to those who are crushed. You cured the woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years. You freed the Canaanite woman's daughter from the fierce demon. You forgave the loan to the two debtors, and You forgave the woman who was a sinner. You gave the paralytic healing along with forgiveness of his sins. You justified the publican by what he said, and You accepted the robber when he confessed in the end. You took up the sins of the world and nailed them to the cross. We pray You and entreat You. In Your goodness, O God, spare and forgive these Your servants. Pardon their transgressions and sins, their voluntary and involuntary offenses, committed knowingly or unknowingly, in defiance or disobedience, night or day. If they have come under the curse of a priest or a parent; if they have feasted their eyes, or indulged their senses of smell, touch or taste; if they have been detached from Your will and Your holiness, through whichever impulse of flesh or spirit; if they and we ourselves have sinned in any way, forgive us, O good and forgiving and benevolent God, and don't let us fall into a lifestyle of impurity or run off into ways that are destructive. Yes indeed, O Lord and Master, hear me now, as I the sinner pray for these Your servants. Overlook all their offenses, O forgiving God, and grant them reprieve from everlasting punishment. Fill their mouths with Your praise, and open their lips to glorify Your holy name. Extend their hands to perform Your commandments, and direct their feet on the course of Your Gospel. Make all their members and their thoughts secure in Your grace. For You are our God, who through Your holy Apostles instructed us, saying: \"Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" And again, \"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\" And as You heard Hezekiah when he was at the point of death and his soul was troubled, and You did not overlook his prayer, so likewise hear me, Your humble, sinful and unworthy servant, as I now pray to You. For You, O Lord Jesus Christ, are the One who in Your mercy and benevolence commanded us to forgive seventy times seven those who fall into sin. You relent from punishing our wicked deeds, and rejoice at the return of those who have strayed. For as Your majesty is, so is Your mercy; and we send up glory to You and Your unoriginate Father and Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages."

euUNC.Key0900.title = "Prayer 7"
euUNC.Key0901.text = "Master, Lord our God, physician of souls and bodies, You treat chronic illnesses; You heal every disease and infirmity among the people. You desire all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth; You do not will the death of sinners, but rather that they should turn from their ways and live. O Lord, in the Old Testament, You appointed repentance for sinners: for David and the Ninevites, and for those before and after them. Again, when You came in the flesh, You did not call the righteous but sinners to repentance; like the publican, the harlot, and the robber, whom You accepted when they repented, and the great apostle Paul, who had been a blasphemer and persecutor. And after Your preeminent apostle Peter denied You three times, when he repented You accepted him and received him, and You told him, \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.\" So we, too, are encouraged by Your infallible promise, and we now pray and entreat You, O good and benevolent God: Hear our prayer, and accept it as incense offered to You, and visit these Your servants, and however they may have transgressed, in word, deed, or thought, night or day, or if they have come under the curse of a priest, or cursed themselves, or sworn an oath and broken it, we pray You and entreat You to spare, forgive, and pardon them, O God, and to overlook the transgressions and sins that they committed knowingly or unknowingly. And if they defied or disobeyed any of Your commandments, either due to living physically in the world, or through some action of the devil, please forgive them, O good and benevolent God. After all, there is no one who lives and does not sin. Only You are sinless. Your righteousness is forever, and Your word is truth. You created humanity not for ruin, but to keep Your commandments, and to inherit indestructible life. Therefore we send up glory to You and Your unoriginate Father and Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages."

And I pray [with them] and implore Your most sympathetic and forgiving benevolence, O God our Savior, who through Your prophet Nathan granted David the forgiveness of his sins when he repented, and who accepted the penitential prayer of Manasseh. Please accept these Your servants who repent of their transgressions, and overlook all their offenses, in Your characteristic benevolence. For You are our God, who said to forgive those who fall into sin, even seventy times seven, because as Your majesty is, so is Your mercy. And all glory, honor and worship belong to You and Your unoriginate Father and Your all-holy Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages."
