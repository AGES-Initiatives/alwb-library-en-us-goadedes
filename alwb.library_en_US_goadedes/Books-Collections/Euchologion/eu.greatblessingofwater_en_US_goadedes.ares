euGW.Prayer11.text = "Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, true God, the source of life and immortality, light from light, who came into the world to enlighten it: Illumine our mind, by Your Holy Spirit, and accept us, as we ascribe to You greatness and gratitude, for the mighty miracles You performed from the beginning, and for Your plan for salvation in these last times. According to this plan, You, the King of the universe, put on our infirm substance and assumed the position of servitude, and even accepted to be immersed in the River Jordan by the hand of a servant, so that You who are sinless might sanctify the element of water and pave the way for our rebirth through water and the Spirit and restore us to our original freedom. As we celebrate the commemoration of this divine mystery, O benevolent Master, we entreat You: Sprinkle cleansing water, the gift of Your tender mercy, on us Your unworthy servants, according to Your divine promise, so that the prayer of us sinners over this water be well received by Your goodness, and so that Your blessing be granted through it to us and to all Your faithful people, to the glory of Your holy and worshipful name."

euGW.Prayer21.text = "Trinity, superessential, surpassingly good, supremely divine, omnipotent, omniscient, invisible, inconceivable, Creator of spiritual entities and intelligent beings, intrinsic goodness, unapproachable light that enlightens every man coming into the world, shine in me Your unworthy servant; illumine the eyes of my mind, so that I may dare to extol Your immense beneficence and power. May this supplication of mine for the people here present be well received, and let not my offences prevent Your Holy Spirit from being here. Rather permit me now to address You blamelessly, and to say to You, O supremely good God: We glorify You, benevolent Master, pre-eternal King and Ruler over all! We glorify You, the creator and maker of all! We glorify You, only-begotten Son of God, born from Your Mother without a father, and from Your Father without a mother. In the previous feast, we saw You, the infant; and in this one we see You, the mature adult, our perfect God from perfect God, who appeared on earth."

euGW.Prayer22.text = "Today, the season to celebrate is upon us. In church with us is the host of Saints, Angels and humans celebrate together. Today, the grace of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove descended upon the waters. Today, the unsetting Sun arose, and the world is brightened by the light of the Lord. Today, the moon, along with the world, is illuminated by the brilliant rays. Today, the stars are sparkling and they adorn the earth with shining radiance. Today, the clouds are sprinkling on mankind the heavenly rain of righteousness."

euGW.Prayer23.text = "Today, the Uncreated is intentionally touched by the hand of His creature. Today, the Prophet and Forerunner approaches the Lord, but he serves Him with trembling, beholding God’s condescension to us. Today, by the presence of the Lord, the Jordan’s waters are transformed into cures. Today, all creation is watered by mystical streams. Today, people’s failures are wiped out in the waters of the Jordan. Today, Paradise is opened to people, and the Sun of Righteousness shines on us."

euGW.Prayer24.text = "Today, the bitter water during the time of Moses is made sweet for the people, because of the Lord’s presence. Today, we are liberated from the old lament, and, as the new Israel, we are delivered. Today, we are rescued from the darkness, and we are illumined by the light of divine knowledge. Today, the mist over the world is removed, because of our God’s appearance. Today, the brilliant light from on high shines on all creation. Today, error and delusion are quashed, and the Master’s advent opens for us the way of salvation."

euGW.Prayer25.text = "Today, heaven celebrates with earth, and earth converses with heaven. Today, the sacred assembly of the Orthodox is resoundingly celebrating. Today, the Master comes to be baptized, in order to lift human nature to heaven. Today, the unbowed Master bows before His servant, in order to free us from slavery. Today, we have purchased the kingdom of heaven. The Lord’s kingdom shall have no end. Today, earth and sea share the joy of the world, and the world is filled with gladness."

euGW.Prayer26.text = "The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and were afraid. The Jordan turned back, when it saw the fire of divinity bodily go down and into it. The Jordan turned back, when it saw the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove come down and hover over You. The Jordan turned back, when it saw the Invisible visible, the Creator incarnate, the Master in the form of a servant. The Jordan turned back, and the mountains skipped, when they saw God in the flesh; and the clouds uttered their voice, as they watched their Master’s assembly at the Jordan today, and they marveled at You who came, light from light, true God from true God; when in the Jordan You buried the death that resulted from disobedience, the sting of error and delusion, and the shackles of Hades, and You presented saving baptism to the world."

euGW.Prayer32.text = "You intentionally brought the universe from nothing into being. You hold creation together by Your power. You govern the cosmos by Your providence. When You constituted the created world out of the Four Elements, You crowned the cycle of the year with four seasons. All the spiritual hosts tremble before You. The sun extols You. The moon glorifies You. The stars converse with You. Light obeys You. The depths shudder at You. Springs and fountains serve You. You stretched out the heavens like a curtain. You made firm the earth on the waters. You surrounded the sea with a wall of sand. You poured out the air for all to breathe."

euGW.Prayer33.text = "Angelic powers minister to You. Hosts of Archangels worship You. The many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim, standing around You and flying about, cover themselves in awe of Your unapproachable glory."

euGW.Prayer34.text = "You who are God, uncircumscribed, without beginning, and ineffable, came to earth, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men, because in Your tender mercy, O Master, You did not bear to see the human race being tortured by the devil; so You came and saved us. We acknowledge Your gift, we proclaim Your mercy, we do not hide Your goodness. You freed the offspring of our nature. By being born You sanctified a virgin womb. All creation extolled You at Your epiphany. You, our God, were seen upon the earth and lived among men. When You sent down Your all-holy Spirit from heaven and crushed the heads of the dragons who were lurking in the water, You sanctified the River Jordan."

So that all who draw this waster and drink it may use it for cleansing of soul and body, healing of illness, house blessings, and any other beneficial purpose."

euGW.Prayer37.text = "You are our God, who by water and the Spirit renewed nature that was worn out by sin. You are our God, who by the flood waters in the days of Noah washed away sin. You are our God, who through the sea by Moses freed the Hebrew people from slavery to Pharaoh. You are our God, who split the rock in the desert, and waters flowed, and brooks flooded, and You gave the people water to drink and satisfied them. You are our God, who with water and fire by Elijah disabused Israel of the deceit of Baal."
