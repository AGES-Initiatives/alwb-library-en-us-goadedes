And You are upright in all Your works; all that You have done to us, You have done in righteousness and true judgment. When You fashioned man from the earth and honored him with Your image, O God, You placed him in the Garden of Eden and promised him immortal life and the enjoyment of eternal blessings if he kept Your commandments. But he disobeyed You, the true God who had created him, and he succumbed to the serpent's deceit, and he died because of his own offenses; and You, O God, in Your righteous judgment, expelled him from Paradise to this world. You returned him to the earth from which he was taken, and You provided for his salvation by regeneration, which is in Your Christ. For You did not forever reject Your creature that You made, O Good One; You did not forget the work of Your hands, but rather in Your tender mercy You visited us in many ways: You sent Prophets; You did signs through Your saints who pleased You in every generation; You spoke to us by the mouths of the Your servants the Prophets and announced to us salvation that was to come; You gave the Law to help us; You appointed Angels to guard us. And when the time had fully come, You spoke to us through Your Son, through whom You also created the world. Since He reflects Your glory and bears the very stamp of Your nature, and He upholds the universe by His word of power, He did not count equality with You, God the Father, a thing to be grasped; but rather being eternal God, He was seen upon the earth and lived among men. He became incarnate from a holy Virgin and emptied himself; He took the form of a servant and became like our lowly body, in order to make us be like His glorious image. Because sin came into the world through a man and death through sin, O God and Father, Your only-begotten Son, who is in Your bosom, was well pleased to be born of a woman, the holy Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary, to be born under the law, and to condemn sin in His flesh, so that as in Adam all die, so also in Him, Your Christ, all be made alive. Living in this world and leaving saving commandments, He delivered us from the error of idolatry and led us to the knowledge of You, the true God and Father; and He acquired us as His own special people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. He cleansed us by water and sanctified us with the Holy Spirit, and He gave himself as an exchange to death, by which we were held captive, sold under sin. Through the cross He descended into the netherworld, so that He might fill all things with himself, and He loosed the pangs of death. He rose on the third day and for all flesh opened the way to resurrection from the dead, as it was not possible for Him, the Author of life, to be held by corruption. And thus He became the first fruits of those who have died, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent. He ascended into heaven and sat at the right hand of Your majesty on high; and He will come to render to each, according to their works. He left us with these memorials of His saving Passion, which we have set before You according to His commands. When He was about to go to His voluntary, celebrated, and life-giving death, on the night when He gave himself up for the life of the world, He took bread in His holy and immaculate hands, showed it to You, God and Father, and when He had given thanks, blessed it, hallowed it, and broken it, "

In return for transient and perishable things on earth, grant them eternal and imperishable things in heaven. Remember, O Lord, those who dwell in deserts and on mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. Remember, O Lord, those who lead a celibate life in chastity, godliness, and asceticism. Remember, O Lord, our elected officials, whom you have allowed to govern on earth. Arm our government with truth, and cover it with favor as with a shield. Overshadow our country in the day of war. Strengthen our armed forces, and exalt their right hand. Establish our country, and subdue all foreign enemies that seek war.

Keep the good in Your goodness; and in Your kindness, make the bad be good. Remember, O Lord, the people here present and those who are absent with good cause. Have mercy on them and on us, according to the abundance of Your mercy. Fill their shelves with goods; preserve their marriages in peace and harmony; nurture the infants; instruct the youth; support the elderly; encourage the fainthearted; reunite the dispersed; return those who succumbed to error and unite them to Your holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. Free those who are troubled by unclean spirits. Travel with those who travel. Defend the widows; protect the orphans; free the captives; heal the sick. Remember, O Lord, those who are on trial, in labor camps, in exile, in bitter servitude, and any affliction, necessity, or distress, and everyone in need of Your great compassion; and those who love us and those who hate us; those who have asked us to pray for them, unworthy though we may be. Remember, O Lord our God, all Your people, and pour out Your rich mercy on all of them, and grant everyone their requests that contribute to their salvation. Remember, O God, everyone whom we have failed to commemorate, either through ignorance or omission or because of the many names, since You know the name and age of each, even from their mother's womb. For You, O Lord, are the help of the helpless, the hope of the hopeless, the savior of those in trouble, the port for travelers, and the physician of the sick.

In return for transient and perishable things on earth, grant them eternal and imperishable things in heaven.

Speak good things in their hearts regarding Your Church and all Your people, so that they may conduct their duties in tranquility and we may live a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and propriety.

Free those who are troubled by unclean spirits. Travel with those who travel. Defend the widows; protect the orphans; free the captives; heal the sick. Remember, O Lord, those who are on trial, in labor camps, in exile, in bitter servitude, and any affliction, necessity, or distress, and everyone in need of Your great compassion; and those who love us and those who hate us; those who have asked us to pray for them, unworthy though we may be. Remember, O Lord our God, all Your people, and pour out Your rich mercy on all of them, and grant everyone their requests that contribute to their salvation.
